After choosing a major intellectual figure of the Scientific Revolution or Enlightenment (17th or 18th centuries), students determine the different networks in which that intellectual took part. In this way, we seek to understand which networks were important to making certain individuals – but also certain intellectual movements – successful, as well as to understand how these different movements depended on different networks.\r\n\r\n#### List of the intellectual figures whose networks the students are mapping:\r\n* John Adams\r\n* Robert Boyle\r\n* Nicolaus Copernicus\r\n* René Descartes\r\n* Denis Diderot\r\n* Benjamin Franklin\r\n* Galileo Galilei\r\n* Thomas Hobbes\r\n* Thomas Jefferson\r\n* Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\r\n* John Locke\r\n* James Madison\r\n* Montesquieu\r\n* Isaac Newton\r\n* Jean-Jacques Rousseau\r\n* Adam Smith\r\n* Voltaire\r\n* George Washington\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
